## Usage Examples

### Depositing Time Credits

```clarity

## Important Notes

1. The contract includes safety measures such as minimum pool balance and maximum usage to ensure system stability.
2. Bonus rates are dynamically calculated based on current pool usage and can be adjusted by the contract owner within predefined limits.
3. The contract emits events for time exchanges, which can be used for off-chain tracking and analysis.
4. An emergency pause function is available to the contract owner to halt exchanges in case of unexpected issues.


## Security Considerations

- Ensure that only authorized addresses can call governance functions.
- Regularly monitor the pool usage and bonus rates to maintain system health.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and multi-sig functionality for critical operations.
